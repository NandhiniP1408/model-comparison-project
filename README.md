Customer Churn Data Preparation & EDA üìä
This project focuses on a comprehensive data analysis of a telecom customer churn dataset. The objective is to prepare the data for machine learning modeling by performing a series of data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) steps.

The analysis provides key insights into the factors that drive customer churn, which can be used by the business to develop targeted customer retention strategies.

üìù Project Task Flow
The project follows a structured approach to data analysis and preparation:

Data Understanding:

Load the dataset and perform initial checks using .info() and .describe() to understand its structure, data types, and identify any issues like missing values or incorrect data types.

Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values in the TotalCharges column, which were initially represented as spaces " ".

Convert the TotalCharges column from an object type to a float.

Remove the customerID column as it is not useful for modeling.

Feature Engineering:

Create a new categorical feature called TenureGroup by binning the continuous tenure column. This helps analyze churn based on customer longevity.

Calculate AvgMonthlySpend by dividing TotalCharges by tenure.

Convert all binary Yes/No columns (e.g., Partner, Churn) to a numerical format (1/0).

Apply one-hot encoding to key categorical features like Contract, InternetService, and PaymentMethod to prepare them for modeling.

EDA & Visualization:

Visualize the data to uncover patterns and relationships. This includes:

A Countplot to see the distribution of churned vs. non-churned customers.

A Barplot to compare the churn rate across different contract types.

A Boxplot to analyze the distribution of MonthlyCharges for churned and non-churned customers.

A Heatmap to show the correlations between numerical features.

üí° Top 5 Insights
Based on the analysis, here are the top five insights gained from the dataset:

Contract Type Matters: Customers on month-to-month contracts have a significantly higher churn rate compared to those with one-year or two-year contracts.

Fiber Optic and Churn: The churn rate is noticeably higher for customers with fiber optic internet service than for those with DSL or no internet service, suggesting potential issues with service quality or pricing.

Tenure and Churn: Customers in their first year of service (TenureGroup '0-12') are the most likely to churn. The churn rate decreases as tenure increases.

Monthly Charges Impact: Customers with higher monthly charges are more prone to churning, indicating a possible link between high cost and customer dissatisfaction.

No Churn Difference for Gender: There is no significant difference in churn rates between male and female customers, suggesting that gender is not a key predictor for churn in this dataset.
